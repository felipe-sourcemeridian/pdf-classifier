Set Up Production Enviroment
	sudo  ./interactive_classifier_bootstrap.sh https://s3.amazonaws.com/classifier-process/data/file_transformation.zip 
	the classifier now is running
Set Up Local Enviroment
	sudo ./local_install_classifier.sh
	in the of process he is copy classifier.conf on /etc
Uninstall Classifier Package
	dpkg -r classifier
Set Up Development Enviroment Debian
	sudo ./setup_dev_enviroment.sh
Development Enviroment
	Compile Base Server For Testing
		make baseserver
	Compile Linkapedia Server For Testing:
		make linkapediaserver
	Compile Project:
		make
	Build Debian Package:
		make build_package
		this option generate package for mapreduce boottrap run a zip file called classifier.zip
	Clean Build Files
		make clean
	Run Classifier
		./classifier classifier.conf
Server Tools
The Server Tools is script for testing the server functionality
the directory for this tools is server_tools on the development tree
	classifier_client.py:
		This Application is for testing the classifier server for more information execute ./classifier_client.py -h
	fileserverclient.py:
		This Application is for testing only the server functionality with base server for more information how used the application please runing the next command ./fileserverclient.py -h on the server_tools directory
	linkapediaclient.py:
		This Application is for testing linkpadia's protocol but you need the linkapedia server alone see above how compile the linkapedia server alone for execute the aplication execute the next comand  and see all options ./linkapediaclient.py -h
Classifier Logs:
	When daemon start you can see the logs with the command tail -f /var/logs/syslog
Serilize Tools:
	This Tools is for serializer the text files, you can find this tools on the directory serialize_tools on the development directory
	serialize_file.py:
		for the option and help execute the next command for help ./serialize_tools.py -h
Configuration File
	The Configuration file you set up all option for daemon run has 3 section
	[static_data] 
		this section you set up the files for classifier process request
		state_aho configure the path for word's tree
		list_node configure the path for node list file
		map_word configure the path for map word
		node_musthave path to node must terms
		node_sig_vector path to node sig vector
		unfiltered_node path to unfiltered node
	[daemon]
		this sections is set up options for daemon has online option working_directory this is the path daemon's root jail
	[server]
		port the server's port
		max_request the max number of request that server can handled
		request_timeout when the request's time is more that this value the request is free because is a slow consumer

Debug
For Debug Project with Netbeans Go To Project Properties and Options Build on Make Tag Select Build Command and Set ${MAKE} -f Makefile CFLAGS="-ggdb -DCLASSIFIER_DEBUG=1 -DCLASSIFIER_CONFIG_FILE="\"/path_to_config_file\"" -DCLASSIFIER_SWAPON=1
